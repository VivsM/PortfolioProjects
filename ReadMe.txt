Business Intelligence Analyst Portfolio Project
Project Description
This project focuses on cleaning the "Nashville Housing" dataset using SQL Server. The goal is to prepare the dataset for further analysis and gain insights into the Nashville housing market. By applying various data cleaning techniques and SQL queries, we aim to transform the raw dataset into a clean and structured format that is suitable for business intelligence analysis.

Dataset
The "Nashville Housing" dataset contains information about real estate transactions in the Nashville area. It includes data such as property addresses, sale prices, acreage, sale date, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other relevant details. The dataset is in a raw format and may contain missing values, inconsistencies, or errors that need to be addressed before analysis.

Tools and Technologies Used
SQL Server: The project utilizes SQL Server as the primary tool for data cleaning and analysis. SQL queries are employed to manipulate and transform the dataset.
SQL Management Studio: This tool is used to interact with SQL Server and execute SQL queries efficiently.
Other SQL-related tools: Additional SQL tools like SQL Profiler and SQL Server Data Tools may be used, depending on the requirements of the cleaning process.

Project Steps
Data Exploration: Understand the structure and contents of the dataset by examining the tables, columns, and data types. Identify potential issues, such as missing values, inconsistencies, or outliers.

Data Cleaning: Apply appropriate data cleaning techniques to address the identified issues. This may involve handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, removing duplicates, or transforming data to ensure consistency and integrity.

Data Transformation: Use SQL queries to transform the dataset into a clean and structured format. This may include aggregating data, creating new variables, normalizing data, or merging tables, as necessary for further analysis.

Data Quality Assurance: Perform data quality checks to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of the cleaned dataset. Validate the transformed data against predefined business rules or statistical measures.

Documentation: Document the data cleaning process, including the steps taken, SQL queries used, and any assumptions or decisions made during the cleaning process. This documentation will serve as a reference for future analysis and collaboration.

Project Outcome
The final outcome of this project is a cleaned and transformed dataset ready for business intelligence analysis. The dataset will be in a structured format, free from major data quality issues, and suitable for generating insights and visualizations regarding the Nashville housing market.
